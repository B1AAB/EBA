The graph-based machine learning community has developed 
various strategies for training and using models on large graphs. 
One of the most common approaches is training on sampled subgraphs. 
Accordingly, the ML dataset consists of subgraphs (aka _communities_) 
pseudorandomly sampled from the larger graph.


In general, the specifics of the sampling strategy 
depend on the graph and the intended application. 
This is even more pronounced for the provided Bitcoin graph, 
given its scale, the heterogeneity of its nodes and edges, 
and its extensive longitudinal nature, as it spans many years.


We provide customizable community sampling strategies 
that can be adjusted to fit the data requirements 
of a wide spectrum of application areas. 
The strategies we currently provide are:

- [Random Neighborhood Sampling](./rns)


Additionally, we provide the following ready-to-use sampled communities:
