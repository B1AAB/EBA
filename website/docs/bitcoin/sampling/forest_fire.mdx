Consider a node with an out-degree of 100, where each of its neighbors also has a similar out-degree. 
If the goal is to sample 10 nodes from the neighborhood within 3 hops, 
a BFS traversal will likely return 10 direct neighbors of the root node, 
and a DFS search will likely return the first neighbor found and 9 of that neighbor's neighbors. 
Therefore, neither of these methods will effectively sample nodes up to 3 hops away, 
nor will the sampled subgraph be representative of the broader 3-hop neighborhood structure.


Therefore, to sample representative neighborhoods in the Bitcoin graph, 
we developed a method that randomly selects a subset of neighbors for a root node. 
Then, for each of those selected nodes, it chooses a subset of their immediate neighbors, 
and continues this process until a termination criterion is met. 


This approach aims to sample representative neighborhood subgraphs from the Bitcoin graph, 
addressing the limitations of BFS/DFS mentioned previously. 
The method follows the general principles of the Forest Fire model and is an adaptation of the 
[Forest Fire sampling algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1145/1150402.1150479).
