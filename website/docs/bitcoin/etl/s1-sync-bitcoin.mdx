# Sync a Bitcoin Node

We use [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/) 
to interact with the Bitcoin Mainnet and
retrieve the necessary on-chain data.
This requires running a [full Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node),
i.e., a node that is fully synchronized with the network.

The initial synchronization downloads the entire blockchain history.
Depending on your hardware (CPU performance, disk read/write speed) and network connection,
this process can take a significant amount of time, potentially a week.
Then, we need to index the transactions, which takes an additional day or two to complete.
As of block height `875,000`, syncing a full node requires approximately `850` GB of storage space 
(which continuously increases as new blocks are added to the chain).

Bitcoin Core offers a _prune_ option, which reduces disk space usage by discarding older block data. 
However, for our data collection process, we need a full transaction index (`txindex=1` setting in Bitcoin Core). 
Transaction indexing is incompatible with pruning. 
Therefore, you **must run a non-pruned node** to ensure all necessary transaction data 
can be indexed and retrieved by subsequent steps.


You may take the following steps. 

* Download and install [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/download).


* Start `bitcoin-qt` using the following command.

    ```shell
    cd [installation directory]
    .\bitcoin-qt.exe -server=1 -rest=1 -txindex=1 -rpcworkqueue=100
    ```


  It will take ~6 days for this process to complete. 
  While you could monitor the progress of synchronizing with the network, 
  the UI does not report on the indexing progress. 
  Hence, after synchronization is complete, the indexing is in progress, 
  and `bitcoin-qt` will not respond (properly) to API calls before this process finishes. 
  You may "monitor" the indexing progress by monitoring the `\indexes\txindex` directory for changed/added files.

  EBA is optimized for concurrency and may send many API requests to `bitcoin-qt`, 
  whose degree of parallelization is dynamically adjusted based on the bandwidth and prior response times. 
  Hence, without setting the `rpcworkqueue`, you may get a `503` error when EBA creates many concurrent requests 
  (e.g., see [this error](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/767ee2e3a1082468b4e2248bac3ef8bd54bb2ddb/src/httpserver.cpp#L269)).



- Test if the client is correctly set up and responding using the following `GET` request:
    
    ```
    GET localhost:8332/rest/chaininfo.json
    ```


## Privacy best practices

Do **NOT** define your real Wallet on this `bitcoin-qt` instance 
(i.e., the Wallet you may have used on any Bitcoin exchange service for Bitcoin trading). 
EBA does **NOT** try to access Wallets defined in `bitcoin-qt` or 
make any attempts at malicious action. 
Regardless, there are some known privacy concerns when running `bitcoin-qt` 
with a defined wallet while the REST API is enabled. 
See [Bitcoin docs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/REST-interface.md#risks).
