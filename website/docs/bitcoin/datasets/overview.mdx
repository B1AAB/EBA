To help you get started quickly, 
we offer several entry points into the dataset. 
Choose the path that best matches your application 
and available resources.



* Skip data pre-processing & **start modeling**

    *   Best for rapid prototyping 
    *   Lightweight (runs in Colab)

    This option helps you understand the data structure 
    and start building immediately, 
    without needing to install or host a database.

    -   [Download generic sampled communities](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aab/bitcoin-graph-sampled-communities) 
        to build your own models
    -   Run 
        [graph 101 (g101) Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/B1AAB/GraphStudio/blob/main/g101/g101.ipynb), 
        or explore 
        [quickstart demo models](https://github.com/B1AAB/GraphStudio/tree/main/quickstart)


* Skip the ETL pipeline & **sample your own communities**
    
    *   Best for specialized applications
    *   Resource-intensive with long runtimes
    
    This option enables you to sample custom neighborhoods 
    tailored to your specific application.


    -   [Import graph into a Neo4j database](/docs/bitcoin/etl/import) 
        or 
        [restore the database dump](/docs/bitcoin/etl/restore)
    -   [Documentation](/docs/bitcoin/sampling/overview) on sampling your own graphs


* Skip the Bitcoin node sync and chain traverse & **use summary statistics** 

    *   Best for macro analysis
    *   Lightweight (Runs in Colab)

    This option provides longitudinal statistics of the Bitcoin blockchain, 
    which you can study individually or use to augment multi-modal architectures.
