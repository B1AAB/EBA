As part of traversing the Bitcoin blockchain, 
we collect summary statistics for each block. 
You may download the summary statistics for 
blocks up to block `863 000` from 
[this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjalili/bitcoin-block-metadata).


The statistics are provided in a tabular format 
and contain the following columns.


### Features parsed from block header

* `BlockHeight`: The block height.
* `Confirmations`: The number of blocks confirmed in the chain after this block ([block confirmation](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Confirmation)).
* `MedianTime`: The Median Time-Past of the block ([Median time-past](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki)).
* `Bits`: The compact representation of the hashing target ([compact representation of hashing target](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/block/bits)).
* `Difficulty`: The block mining difficulty ([block mining difficulty](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/guide/difficulty)).
* `Size`: The block's data size in bytes.
* `StrippedSize`: The block's data size without its SegWit witness data.
* `Weight`: The block's weight ([block's weight](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/transaction/size)).
* `TxCount`: The number of transactions in the block.

### Parser Log

*   `Runtime(seconds)`: The time it took to parse the block.
*   `Retries`: A debugging-level log that counts the number of 
    attempts it took to parse the block. 
    This will be mostly $1$ unless the parser has run 
    into throttle-related issues.


### Block's transaction and script summary stats

*   `MintedBitcoins`: 
    Amount of new coins generated in the block.

*   `TransactionFees`: 
    Sum of transaction fees paid.

*   `CoinbaseOutputsCount`: 
    Number of output scripts in the coinbase transaction.

*   `InputsCounts[Sum, Max, Min, Avg, Median, Variance]`: 
    For the set of input counts per transaction across all 
    transactions in the block, this reports their sum, max, 
    min, average, median, and variance.

*   `OutputsCounts[Sum, Max, Min, Avg, Median, Variance]`: 
    For the set of output counts per transaction across all 
    transactions in the block, this reports their sum, max, 
    min, average, median, and variance.

*   `InputsValues[Sum, Max, Min, Avg, Median, Variance]`: 
    For the set of BTC values of inputs per transaction 
    across all transactions in the block, this reports 
    their sum, max, min, average, median, and variance.

*   `OutputValues[Sum, Max, Min, Avg, Median, Variance]`: 
    For the set of BTC values of outputs per transaction 
    across all transactions in the block, this reports 
    their sum, max, min, average, median, and variance.

*   `ScriptType[*]`: 
    Reports the count of each script type observed across 
    all transactions in the block, where the recorded script types are:
    `PubKey`, `PubKeyHash`, `ScriptHash`, `witness_v0_keyhash`, 
    `witness_v0_scripthash`, `witness_v1_taproot`, 
    `witness_unknown`, `multisig`, `nonstandard`, 
    `NullData`, `Coinbase`, `Unknown`.

*   `SpentOutputAge[Max, Min, Avg, Median, Variance]`:
    For all transaction outputs (Txo) spent in this block, 
    this reports the max, min, average, median, and variance 
    of their age. 
    Age is defined as the difference between the current 
    block height and the block height where Txo was created. 


### Block's graph summary stats

    * `BlockGraph[*]EdgeCount`: Counts the number of edge types 
    created for the transactions of this block. 
    The `*` is one of the following:

        *   `C2TMinting`: 
            $\text{Coinbase}_u \xrightarrow{\text{Minting}} \text{Tx}_v$

        *   `C2SMinting`: 
            $\text{Coinbase}_u \xrightarrow{\text{Minting}} \text{Script}_v$

        *   `T2TTransfer`: 
            $\text{Tx}_u \xrightarrow{\text{Transfer}} \text{Tx}_v$

        *   `T2TFee`: 
            $\text{Tx}_u \xrightarrow{\text{Fee}} \text{Tx}_v$

        *   `S2STransfer`: 
            $\text{Script}_u \xrightarrow{\text{Transfer}} \text{Script}_v$

        *   `S2SFee`: 
            $\text{Script}_u \xrightarrow{\text{Fee}} \text{Script}_v$

        *   `C2TMinting`: 
            $\text{Coinbase}_u \xrightarrow{\text{Minting}} \text{Tx}_v$

        *   `C2SMinting`: 
            $\text{Coinbase}_u \xrightarrow{\text{Minting}} \text{Script}_v$

        *   `T2TTransfer`: 
            $\text{Tx}_u \xrightarrow{\text{Transfer}} \text{Tx}_v$

        *   `T2TFee`: 
            $\text{Tx}_u \xrightarrow{\text{Fee}} \text{Tx}_v$

        *   `S2STransfer`: 
            $\text{Script}_u \xrightarrow{\text{Transfer}} \text{Script}_v$

        *   `S2SFee`: 
            $\text{Script}_u \xrightarrow{\text{Fee}} \text{Script}_v$


### Script address stats


*   `TotalAddressesInBlock`: The total count of all script addresses in the block, including duplicates.

*   `UniqueAddressesInBlock`: The count of unique script addresses in the block.

*   `CumulativeUniqueAddresses`: The count of unique script addresses that appear for the first time in this block.
