The dataset is organized into separate TSV files 
for nodes and edges based on their schema. 
The files do not contain a header line, 
instead, a corresponding `*_header.tsv.gz` 
file provides the column names for each node or edge type.
All files are grouped into batches and 
pre-formatted for Neo4j's bulk import tool. 


The dataset consists of `1 966` files (`1.17 TB`) 
and is available for download from [this page](/releases/data-release/v1#bitcoin-graph).
