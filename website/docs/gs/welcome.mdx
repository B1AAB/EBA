# Welcome

We provide large-scale temporal graphs of blockchain data 
that enable you to develop ML applications across the vibrant cryptocurrency ecosystem, 
including:

* Exploring economic evolution and temporal behaviors.
* Analyzing network dynamics and trading patterns.
* Identifying suspicious or illicit activities.
* Benchmarking large-scale, graph-based machine learning models.


EBA interfaces with the Bitcoin network and 
creates a graph of the full history of 
transactions recorded on-chain, 
encompassing the complete trading details of 
over `8.72` billion BTC. 
The temporal heterogeneous graph consists of 
over `2.4` billion nodes 
and `39.72` billion time-stamped edges 
spanning more than a decade, 
making it a complete resource for developing 
models on Bitcoin and a large-scale resource 
for benchmarking graph neural networks.


We share the complete ETL pipeline and all 
the data it generates. To simplify working with the 
pipeline and its resources, we have split them into 
separate repositories. 
The following is the list of resources we provide for Bitcoin:

- [Datasets](/docs/bitcoin/datasets/overview):
    - [Block Statistics](/docs/bitcoin/datasets/stats)
    - [Bitcoin Graph in neo4j format](/docs/bitcoin/datasets/neo4j-format)
    - [Bitcoin Graph in TSV format](/docs/bitcoin/datasets/tsv-format)
- Tools:
    - [Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline](/docs/bitcoin/etl/overview)
    - [Community Sampling](/docs/bitcoin/sampling/overview)
- ML:
    - Example models: [Graph Studio](https://github.com/b1aab/graphstudio)
    - [External and off-chain labels](https://github.com/B1AAB/GraphStudio/tree/main/off_chain_resources/)
