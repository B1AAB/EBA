# Welcome

:::tip The Motivation
EBA addresses a long-standing issue that has hindered the 
ML community from developing applications for Bitcoin:
**a lack of ML-first data.**
:::


### The Challenge

The paradox of publicly accessible blockchain data is that 
its cryptography-first design, 
a necessity for a decentralized ledger, 
has impeded its adoption by the ML community. 
Accordingly, blockchains use models such as the 
Unspent Transaction Output (UTxO) 
that do not readily provide information from which 
an ML model can learn the topology of financial flows 
for predictive tasks like market forecasting or 
classification tasks like anomaly detection.



Specifically, the friction for ML from this cryptography-first design is twofold. 
First, UTxO-like models provide only a static snapshot of 
financial flows (i.e., the transaction), and 
reconstructing the actual flow of how funds are earned and spent 
requires additional traversal of the blockchain. 
Arguably, this flow provides more information for ML applications 
than the snapshot. 
Second, unlike the common perception of a transaction where
"$x$ sends $Z$ amount to $y$",
the UTxO model encodes it as a complex process where 
"cryptographic proof of ownership (from the set $\{x\}$) 
unlocks a set of previously unspent atomic currency units, 
and this sum ($Z$) is then 
split and re-locked under a new cryptographic locking mechanism 
where only the intended recipients can unlock (the set $\{y\}$)". 
This latter description is what is publicly recorded on the blockchain, 
and it is not ML-friendly. 
EBA addresses both of these issues.




### The Solution

EBA interfaces with the Bitcoin network and 
creates a graph of the full history of transactions recorded on-chain. 
On this graph, the nodes are Bitcoin _scripts_ (aka _addresses_), 
and the edges between them represent transactions recorded on-chain via the UTxO model.
Simply put, 
the graph represents a transaction between $x$ and $y$ as 
a time-stamped, directed edge between their corresponding nodes. 
Consequently, the flow of how funds are earned and spent can be traced 
by traversing these paths. 
This graph is built for ML, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in particular, 
allowing a graph-based model to aggregate information from neighbors 
through message passing and learn the topology of fund flows for various applications. 



The Bitcoin Graph that EBA creates encompasses 
the complete trading details of over `8.72` billion BTC,
and it consists of over `2.4` billion nodes and 
`39.72` billion time-stamped edges spanning more than a decade, 
making it a complete resource for developing models on Bitcoin and 
a large-scale resource for benchmarking graph neural networks. 



We share the complete ETL pipeline and all 
the data it generates. To simplify working with the 
pipeline and its resources, we have split them into 
separate repositories. 
The following is the list of resources we provide for Bitcoin:

- Datasets:
    -   [Dataset releases](http://localhost:3000/releases/tags/data-releases)
    -   [Documentation](/docs/bitcoin/datasets/overview)
    -   [Bitcoin graph in neo4j format](/docs/bitcoin/datasets/tsv)
    -   [Block statistics](/docs/bitcoin/datasets/stats)
- Tools:
    -   [Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline](/docs/bitcoin/etl/overview)
    -   [Community sampling](/docs/bitcoin/sampling/overview)
- ML:
    -   [Quick-start example model](https://github.com/B1AAB/GraphStudio/tree/main/quickstart/script_classification): 
        Trains a model on sampled communities that learns to generate node embeddings 
        by aggregating neighborhood features through message passing, 
        then uses these embeddings for script node clustering.
    -   [External and off-chain resources](https://github.com/B1AAB/GraphStudio/tree/main/off_chain_resources/)



### The Application

This graph is built for machine learning, 
particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
allowing a graph-based model to 
aggregate information from neighbors through message passing and 
learn the topology of fund flows for various applications 
across the vibrant cryptocurrency ecosystem, including:

*   Exploring economic evolution and temporal behaviors.
*   Analyzing network dynamics and trading patterns.
*   Identifying suspicious or illicit activities.
*   Benchmarking large-scale, graph-based machine learning models.
